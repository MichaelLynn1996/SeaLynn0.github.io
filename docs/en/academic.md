## Research Interest

The primary research focus of my master's studies:

- Audio Pattern Recognition: audio tagging, acoustic scene classification, music classification, speech classification and sound event detection, etc.
- Foundation Model (Transformer) for Audio Pattern Recognition or Multimodal Applications.
- Parameter-efficiency Fine-tuning technique: Adapetr, Prompt(Prefix) and LoRA, etc.

At the same time, I am also researching:

- Computer Vision: Providing inspiration for the study of audio pattern recognition and meeting the project requirements of the internship company.
- Time Series Prediction: Similarly for the internship company's project, integrating cutting-edge deep time series prediction techniques with specific scenarios in quantitative trading.
